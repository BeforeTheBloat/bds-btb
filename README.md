## ‚öíÔ∏è Get Started
To get started, you need to have these system requirements:
 - Windows 10 version and above
 - Ubuntu or Debian
 - ...or really, most operating systems with a working C++ compiler :D

If you just want to get started immediately you can grab an executable from our [releases tab](https://github.com/BeforeTheBloat/bds-btb/releases), and run it from there.

**However if you want to build this project, you will need to compile the code from the native branch, for Windows 10/11 or Linux using CMake.**

### Instructions building on Windows (MSVC)
We use CMake for our projects, but to compile on Windows, MSVC is required to be installed. Mostly MSVC, comes with C++ on Visual Studio, but there are other ways to get MSVC on your device.
```bat
cmake . -Bbin && cmake --build bin && "./bin/bds_btb.exe"
```

### Instructions building on Linux
Similar to Linux, you need to check for a compiler, such as Clang and GCC (the two most recommended compilers for this project on Linux).
```sh
cmake . -Bbin && cmake --build bin && "./bin/bds_btb"
```

### Tested Compilers
- [x] MSVC
- [x] GCC
- [x] Clang

## üåü Features
- **Native cross-platform support:** We make it our top priority for Windows and Linux to run well without need of an emulator.
- **High-level Performance:** Fast performance on our app (it's a console program), and is built on C++ which is one of the fastest languages used today.
- **Full of Features:** Every vanilla feature that you would normally be provided with in vanilla Minecraft Bedrock Edition v1.1.x.
- **Super-easy Lua API:** Easy-to-learn Lua API for you to use to make custom plugins and scripts.
